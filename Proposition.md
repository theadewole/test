Hello Sir,

Over the weekend, I conducted research on handling the transformation process.
On Friday, I met with Mr. Segun, and we will have another meeting scheduled for Tuesday, where Mr. Seun will also join.

During the meeting, I discussed the possibility of using an API to interface with a user-defined assistant on ChatGPT.
Before that, I had already consulted ChatGPT on how to achieve this and received some responses.

I believe integrating the API could enhance the functionality of the assistant I created on ChatGPT. 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the **Action Menu** I developed last month, I manually performed DM mapping in SAS, then used the assistant to replicate the same process. 
I then compared both files, and the results are as follows:

## Summary of the Comparison 
### Similarities:
Same Number of Observations: Both datasets have 87 observations.

Common Variables: 10 variables are present in both datasets.

Majority of Values Match: 66 observations have all compared variables equal.

Some Age Values Are the Same: 7 out of 10 variables compared have equal values across all observations.

## Differences:
- Extra Variable in dm_chatgpt.csv: It has one additional variable that is not present in me.csv.
- Differences in AGE Values:
    - 21 observations have differing values.
    - The largest difference in AGE values is 13 years.
    - Example discrepancies:
        - Obs 3: 40 (me.csv) vs. 33 (dm_chatgpt.csv) → Difference: -7
        - Obs 17: 21 (me.csv) vs. 33 (dm_chatgpt.csv) → Difference: +12
        - Obs 32: 46 (me.csv) vs. 33 (dm_chatgpt.csv) → Difference: -13

## Differences in RACE and ETHNIC Variables:
- 1 observation has different RACE values.
- 1 observation has different ETHNIC values.
- Example:
    - Obs 86:
        - RACE (me.csv): UNKNOWN → Missing in dm_chatgpt.csv
        - ETHNIC (me.csv): NOT HISPANIC OR LATINO → Missing in dm_chatgpt.csv
## Total Number of Unequal Comparisons:
- 22 values differ across both datasets.
- 2 variables have missing value differences.


### The following 7 variables have completely identical values in both datasets (me.csv and dm_chatgpt.csv), meaning they have no differences:
- USUBJID
- SUBJID
- DOMAIN
- AGEU
- SITEID
- STUDYID
- DMDY

### The following 3 variables have differences between the two datasets (me.csv and dm_chatgpt.csv):
- AGE
- RACE
- ETHNIC
